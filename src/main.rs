//!
//! ## Overview
//!
//! Locksidian is a pure [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) implementation of the
//! [blockchain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain_(database)) technology, and was developed
//! as a study project during our first year of Master degree in *Software Architecture*.
//!
//! Our objective is to provide the ability to store and certify the existence and integrity of any
//! JSON document by storing and cryptographically signing them inside of the `Locksidian`
//! blockchain.
//!
//! All the interactions between the peers of the peer-to-peer network is done using the HTTP(S)/1.1
//! protocol through the use of REST APIs.
//!
//! ## Deeper into the rabbit hole
//!
//! *TODO*

// Third-party dependencies
