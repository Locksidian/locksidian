## Contributing

### Project setup

In order to contribute to the project, you first have to follow these brief setup instructions:

 - Use the `nightly` rust toolchain : `rustup default nightly`.
 - If you are running Windows, the `gcc-rs` dependency requires that you set the `CC=gcc` environment variable in
    order to work properly.
 - If you are running an older 32 bits version of MinGW as your C toolchain, you will have to use the **i686** rust
   toolchain : `rustup default stable-i686-pc-windows-gnu`. You might want to upgrade to `MinGW-w64` using [Win-builds](http://win-builds.org)
   to continue using the 64 bits rust distribution. Don't forget to update your `default-host` in order to use the GNU
   toolchain: `rustup set default-host x86_64-pc-windows-gnu`.
 - Install `lisqslite3` (Windows: https://www.sqlite.org/download.html , Debian package: `apt-get install libsqlite3-dev`).
   Note: if the `-lsqlite3` flag is not recognized during compile time, try to copy all the `libsqlite.*` files into the
   `lib` folder of your current Rust toolchain:
   `<home>/.rustup/toolchains/nightly-x86_64-pc-windows-gnu/lib/rustlib/x86_64-pc-windows-gnu/lib`
   (this problem was only encountered on the Windows platform).
                                                                              
### Commit guidelines

When contributing to the `Locksidian` project, chances are that you will develop a feature that is requested by a specific
**issue**.

In your commit message, please always reference the issue using the following format:

```
Issue #N

 - Some changes
 - Some other interesting facts
 - Whatevs
```

If your commit closed or fixed the corresponding issue, you can use the following titles: `Close #N` or `Fixed #N`.
This way, the issue will be closed automatically when your commit reaches the `master` branch. 

If you are making modifications that are not linked to any open issue (please, don't do this), you *could* use the feature
branch name as the commit title, making it easy to locate the commit origin in the future.
